    <p>Hi! I'm Aditi Shrivastava, and I'm currently a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science+Anthropology with a minor in Game Studies and Design. I'm interested in parts of technology that intersect and interact with humans and creativity in fields like Front-end development, HCI, and UX Research and UI Design. I also love studying internet and gaming cultures. Feel free to reach out!</p>
